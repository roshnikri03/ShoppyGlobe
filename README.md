## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features

- **Framework**: React 19 + Vite (Fast HMR, optimized bundling).
- **Routing**: React Router v6 using `createBrowserRouter` for dynamic path resolution, Outlet layouts, and nested router parameters.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for unified global state:
  - `cartSlice`: Manages cart items, additions, subtractions (restricted to min 1), removals, and cart clearance.
  - `searchSlice`: Drives a real-time global filter on the product catalog from the Header component.
- **Data Fetching**: 
  - Custom React Hook `useFetchProducts` inside `src/hooks/useFetchProducts.js` to handle API list queries with loading and error handlers.
  - Dynamic route detail queries on mount for single products inside the `ProductDetail` component.
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Code-splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for all top-level routes (Home, Details, Cart, Checkout, 404).
  - Native image lazy-loading (`loading="lazy"`) to limit initial page load weight.
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with custom theme design system (HSL color tokens, dark mode/light mode awareness, mobile-first responsive grid layouts, and glassmorphism cards).

## 💡 Key Design Implementations

1. **Props Validation**: Every reusable component utilizes `PropTypes` to validate input shapes, ensuring runtime stability.
2. **Search Logic**: Product listing reads the Redux search state from the store and filters results case-insensitively across categories, brands, and titles in real time.
3. **Cart Constraints**: Adjusting cart quantities is handled via Redux selectors, validating that item counts never fall below `1`.
4. **Checkout flow**: Order placement triggers an action to clear the cart, displays a success window, and automatically redirects the client home using `useNavigate` after a 2.5s timer.
5. **Technical 404 Detail**: The custom `NotFound` component utilizes React Router's `useRouteError` combined with `useLocation` to print technical routing details on screen.
